	<p>Kheer Mix is a handy pre-packaged combination that simplifies rice kheer making because it already contains all the ingredients of kheer. 
	      It typically comprises kheer ingredients such as rice or seviyan, sugar, and other favorable like cardamom, 
	      which are necessary when making this popular delicacy.</p>

	<li><h2> How to make Rice Kheer recipe:</h2></li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
	    <li>Rinse ¼ cup basmati rice a couple of times in fresh water and then soak in enough water for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
	     <li>While the rice grains are soaking, take 1-litre full-fat milk in a heavy wide pan or saucepan or kadai.</li>
	     <li>Keep the pan on low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals so that the milk does not burn at the bottom of the pan.</li>
    	     <li>Let the milk come to a boil.</li>
	     <li>Take 1 tablespoon milk from the pan in a small bowl. Let the milk become warm. Then, add a few saffron strands to the milk. Keep aside.</li>
   	     <li>After the milk begins to boil, drain all the water from the rice and add it to the boiling milk.</li>
      	     <li>Cook the rice grains till they are 50% done or half-done.</li>
	 </ol>
	
	   <li><h1>Biryani Recipe:</h1></li> 
	
	 <p>Adjust the salt and spices to taste. A little acidity from lemon juice or yogurt can brighten the dish. Consider adding a touch of sweetness with dried fruits like raisins or apricots. 
	          Serve biryani with side dishes like raita (yogurt sauce), salad, or boiled eggs to complement the flavors.</p>
